Go Backend Mastery - 2 Week Realistic Time Table

Day 1:
- Install Go environment and setup workspace
- Write and run your first Go program ("Hello World")
- Understand basic syntax: variables, types, constants
- Practice small programs using variables and printing output

Day 2:
- Learn Go data types in detail: int, float, string, bool
- Practice type conversions and type assertions
- Write small functions using these types

Day 3:
- Understand control structures: if-else, switch-case
- Practice writing conditional statements and loops (for)
- Write small programs using loops and conditions

Day 4:
- Learn arrays, slices, and maps in Go
- Practice creating, updating, and iterating over arrays/slices/maps
- Write functions that take arrays/slices/maps as input and return outputs

Day 5:
- Understand structs and pointers in Go
- Practice creating structs, accessing fields, and passing pointers
- Write programs using structs and pointers

Day 6:
- Learn Go interfaces and embedding
- Practice writing interfaces and implementing them in structs
- Understand how interfaces provide abstraction

Day 7:
- Error handling in Go: error type, multiple returns, defer, panic, recover
- Write functions that return errors and handle them properly

Day 8:
- Introduction to Gin framework setup and routing basics
- Create a simple Gin server with GET and POST routes
- Practice writing basic route handlers and sending JSON responses

Day 9:
- Understand request parameters in Gin (path, query, form-data)
- Practice extracting parameters from requests and validation basics

Day 10:
- Middleware in Gin: creating and using middleware for logging and authentication
- Practice adding middleware to your routes

Day 11:
- Connecting MongoDB with Go (using mongo-driver)
- Practice basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on MongoDB

Day 12:
- Implement user signup and signin handlers step by step
- Practice hashing passwords and JWT token generation

Day 13:
- Email verification flow: generate tokens, send emails (mock), verify tokens
- Practice updating user data after verification

Day 14:
- Forgot password feature: generate new password, update DB, send email (mock)
- Review all the above in a mini project that combines signup, signin, email verify, and forgot password

General tips:
- Every day write notes on what you learned and questions that come to your mind
- Practice reading existing backend code line by line and understand every word (variables, functions, structs)
- Always write small test programs for every concept you learn
- Ask for help whenever stuck, no matter how small the issue

Good luck bro, stay consistent! ðŸ’ªðŸ”¥
